# IoT-Project.Intellingent-communication-between-home-and-car
University Project (Politecnico di Bari)  
The aim of the project is to relate the home automation with intelligent vehicle technologies to increase both the comfort and the safety of the user. To this end we want to set a communication  between two Arduino control boards, one installed at home and the other mounted in the car: both of them will collect data by sensors present in the two nodes.
